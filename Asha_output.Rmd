# General markdown tips courtesy of Rstudio

Scroll down to the ASHA section for plots and stats and whatnot

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## ASHA

Welcome to your markdown file! Hooray!

Some amazing scientists collected a heap of fish data. They've analysed it in R, a statistical programming language for tabular data, and the results are AMAZING. Wow!

Here's an awesome plot which shows the distribution of species by ocean basin.

```{r Fish-plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, caption = "AN AWESOME FISH PLOT"}
source("scripts/02_plot_fish_data.R")

plot3
```

Results show that all of the fish found at depth "Bottom" are located in the Pacific Ocean.

```{r Fish2-plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, caption = "AN AWESOME FISH PLOT"}
source("scripts/02_plot_fish_data.R")

plot5
```

```{r lmrsq, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("scripts/03_linear_models_on_fish_data.R")
rsqfitnice <- paste("R^2^ = ", round(rsqfit2, 2))

```

Although all bottom dwelling fish were found in the Pacific Ocean, a linear model of all fish counts and location showed that location only described ~12% of the variance (`r rsqfitnice`).
